 * This class generates the Player, which is controllable with the arrowKeys.
 * Each timer tick the Player object is updated and moves around by adding dx,dy to its x and y coordinates from superclass
 * The player is allowed to move on the whole board, however if he leaves the outer shape, and enters the inner shape
 * the player is vulnerable and can collide with an aiPlayer object. While moving in the inner shape, the player draws a line
 * which coordinates are stored in an arrayList. The line is drawn with a colored path object.
 * Only the following positions are stored in the arrayList:
 *  - the point of entering the inner shape
 *  - every time the player changes the moving direction, a new point with the actual position is added
 *  - the point of entering the outer shape again
 * The keyboard input which is detected by the player is stored in integer values, because they can be easily compared
 * @param x,y Coordinates of the Player, stored in position
 * @param radius radius of the ColoredEllipseShape the Player is extending
 * @param moveSpeed sets how often update is applied per timer tick
 * @param color when drawn
